r"""Example script to read a tag's id

sudo bash -c "echo -n 1-2:1.1 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind"
Flow:
    - Try to read a tag within an infinite loop.
    - If a tag is found then beep once and output Customer ID, UID and CRC Sum.


Note: extra check has been added to avoid processing the same tag (CID/UID) more than once in a row.
